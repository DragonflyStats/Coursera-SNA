Question 1
Referring to the Baker/Faulnker article (see syllabus), conspiracy networks wishing to remain concealed want to be:
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
dense			
decentralized			
hierarchical	Inorrect	0.00	a hierarchical structure may be good for getting things done (there is a clear chain of control and responsibility), but it also presents critical points of failure, e.g. if the head of the conspiracy ring suddenly passes away, the conspiracy may not be able to continue without further direction.
Total		0.00 / 2.00	
Question Explanation

Each edge presents a point of vulnerability: communication that can be intercepted. Especially if communication is centered on a single node, that node's "failure" could bring down the network.

Question 2
Referring to Baker/Faulkner, the centrality measure predictive of whether a person participating in the conspiracy network would be convicted is:
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
PageRank	Inorrect	0.00	PageRank was not considered in the paper.
closeness			
betweenness			
degree			
Total		0.00 / 1.00	
Question Explanation

Only one of these centrality measures was found to be a significant predictor of conviction.

Question 3
Which of the following is an explanation of why some centrality measures were predictive of why a node is convicted while others were not.
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
defendants pleading no contest were not included in the analysis			
the networks were too small to give different values of centrality			
tasks were often delegated to mid-level management	Inorrect	0.00	this is true, but not directly tied to centrality in the paper
hearsay rule			
Total		0.00 / 1.00	
Question Explanation

Check the "Results" section of the paper, which discusses which centrality measures corresponded with whether an individual was convicted.
Question 4
Which of the following is true based on the Aral/Van Alstyne study of worker productivity in a recruiting firm?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
Network diversity does not predict better job performance once the amount of novel information an individual receives is factored in.	Inorrect	0.00	the preliminary findings are that network diversity *does* correlate with better job performance
Larger network size is positively correlated with network diversity.			
In a constrained network a node's neighbors do not communicate with one another.			
Total		0.00 / 2.00	
Question Explanation

Check the paper.
Question 5
Go to the Movie Galaxies representation of the first and third Lord of the Ring movies: The Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King. You can mouse over the nodes to identify them and to find their degree and betweenness. Which of the following is true?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
Gandalf's degree doubles between the first and third movie.	Inorrect	0.00	
Frodo's degree increases between the first and third movie.			
Gandalf's betweenness surpasses that of Frodo between the first movie and the third.			
Legolas has high betweenness in both movies.			
Total		0.00 / 2.00	
Question Explanation

Note that the betweenness shows whether a character in movie interacts with different sets of actors.
Question 6
Download the world trade data for fish and fish products as a GDF file. Load it into Gephi. Apply a filter (Filters->Edges->Edge weight ... drag to Queries, click on Filter) such that only edges are kept where at least 5% (weight = 0.05) of the country's imports of fish stem from the other country. Calculate betweenness by clicking on Statistics -> Av. Path. Length -> Run. Check out the betweenness values in the data laboratory view. Among the choices, the country with the highest betweenness is:
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
Australia			
Libya			
France	Inorrect	0.00	
Spain			
Total		0.00 / 2.00	
Question Explanation

Although the country with the highest betweenness on this list is not the biggest importer or exporter, it does do a fair bit of both and is positioned as a broker in fish trade.
