###### History

Gephi runs on Windows, Mac and Linux. Gephi Consortium was founded in 2010 as a french non-profit corporation which supports development of future releases of Gephi. 

Gephi is one of the most modern graph visualization applications available and certainly adds to the statistical analysis world. Gephi represents a friendly user interface with a sleek design and simple user controls. Gephi is available in English, French, Spanish, Japanese, Russian, Brazilian, Portuguese, Chinese, Czech and German. 

###### Application
Gephi is a Network visualization and analysis platform used when working with different types of networks e.g. online networks or offline networks. The main objective of Gephi is to provide an interactive visualization and exploration platform for all kinds of networks and complex graphs. Gephi creates a graph made up of nodes, a person, place or thing, where the edges represent the relationships between the nodes. 

Nodes can be personalized to include images and no overlapping this makes the experience better for the customer. The open source aspect of Gephi extends to the use of free plugins within the application. These help the digestion of large amounts of data, for example the Semantic Web Plugin which allows for specific Sparql, a query language, searches through large files including Dbpedia, a database of Wikipedia entries.

###### What can Gephi be used for?
* Analyse populations of posts that planning organizations post on their website. 
* Identify key stakeholders in a community or an organization. 
* Undersatnd the relationships between members of a network or an organization. 
* Visualize different communities or sub communities in a network or an organisation.
